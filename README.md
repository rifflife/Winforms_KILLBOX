# Winforms_KILLBOX
This game was built using WinForms.

This is an assignment from my college.
I made it in my first year. And this is my first completed game.

So, when you look at my game code, you might find it's really messy.
You might also feel that it has a strange structure. So please understand me.

All comments in the code were written in Korean.
Also, all explanations and in-game text are written in Korean.
You can change all the Korean text to English, but it might get messy.
It was created for a Korean college assignment,
so I didn't implement a multi-language structure.
It's my big mistake, so please understand this issue.

But you know what? It's fun to play : )

이 게임은 Winforms로 만들어졌습니다.
이 게임은 대학 과제를 위해서 만들어졌습니다.
1학년 과제를 위해 만들어졌기 때문에 미숙한 부분이 많습니다.

모든 주석과 게임 텍스트는 한국어로 작성되었습니다.
다중 언어 지원을 염두에 두지 않고 설계되었기 때문에,
다른 언어로의 변환은 코드 속 한국어 문자열을 변경해야 합니다.
